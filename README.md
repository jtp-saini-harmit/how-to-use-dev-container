     * "Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files..."
     * "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
     * "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   
   - **Predefined Container Definitions**:
     * Choose from many predefined development container definitions
     * Languages support: Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, PHP, etc.
     * Frameworks support: React, Angular, Vue, Django, Flask, etc.
     * Database support: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

   - **Custom Configuration**:
     * Modify devcontainer.json to:
       - Specify base image
       - Install additional tools
       - Configure environment variables
       - Set up port forwarding
       - Mount volumes
       - Add extensions

4. Using Dev Containers:
   ```json
   // Example devcontainer.json
   {
     "name": "My Project",
     "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18",
     "customizations": {
       "vscode": {
         "extensions": [
           "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
           "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
         ]
       }
     },
     "forwardPorts": [3000],
     "postCreateCommand": "npm install"
   }
   ```

11. VS Code will create two files:
    - `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Container configuration
    - `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Container image definition

12. After files are created:
    - VS Code will prompt to "Reopen in Container"
    - Click this to build and start your dev container
    - Wait for the container to build (first time may take a few minutes)
    - You're now working inside the container!

13. Customizing Your Dev Container:
    - Open `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
    - Common customizations:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Your Project Name",
      // Base image or Dockerfile
      "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
      },
      // Install additional VS Code extensions
      "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
          "extensions": [
            "ms-python.python",
            "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker"
          ]
        }
      },
      // Forward ports from container
      "forwardPorts": [3000, 8080],
      // Run commands after container is created
      "postCreateCommand": "npm install",
      // Add environment variables
      "remoteEnv": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
      }
    }
    ```

## Git and GitHub Integration

### Understanding Git and GitHub for Beginners

#### What is Git?
Git is a version control system that runs on your computer. Think of it as a sophisticated "Save As" system that:
- Tracks every change you make to your files
- Lets you review and undo changes
- Works completely offline
- Helps manage different versions of your code

#### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website service that:
- Hosts Git repositories online
- Makes it easy to share your code
- Allows multiple people to work on the same code
- Provides tools for code review and project management

The relationship: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service that hosts Git projects online.

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

#### 1. Initial Git Setup (One-time setup)
1. Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `)
2. Configure your identity:
   ```bash
   # Set your name
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   
   # Set your email (use the same email as your GitHub account)
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

#### 2. GitHub Account Setup (One-time setup)
1. Go to https://github.com
   ![GitHub New Repo Button](images/github-1-new-repo.png)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the registration process
4. Verify your email address

#### 3. Setting Up a New Project with Git
1. Create and enter your project folder
2. Initialize Git in your project:
   ```bash
   # This creates a new Git repository
   git init
   
   # Verify it worked - you should see a hidden .git folder
   dir /a   # on Windows
   ls -la   # on Mac/Linux
   ```

3. Create a .gitignore file (tells Git which files to ignore):
   ```bash
   # Common files to ignore
   .env                # Environment variables
   node_modules/       # Node.js dependencies
   __pycache__/       # Python cache
   .vscode/           # VS Code settings
   *.log              # Log files
   .DS_Store          # Mac system files
   ```

#### 4. Creating Your First Local Save (Commit)
1. Stage your files (prepare them for saving):
   ```bash
   # See which files Git detected
   git status
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Or add specific files
   git add filename.txt
   
   # Check status again to verify
   git status
   ```

2. Save your changes (commit):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
   ```

#### 5. Connecting to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click the "+" in the top-right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   ![GitHub Create Repo](images/github-2-create-repo.png)
   *Select "New repository" from the menu*

   - Fill in your repository details:
     * Name your repository
     * Add an optional description
     * Choose public or private
     * DO NOT initialize with README (we'll upload our existing code)
   ![GitHub Repo Settings](images/github-3-repo-settings.png)
   *Fill in the repository details. Leave "Add a README file" unchecked if you have existing code*

   - Click "Create repository"
   - You'll see the quick setup page with commands to use:
   ![GitHub Quick Setup](images/github-4-quick-setup.png)
   *The quick setup page shows the commands you'll need to run*

2. Connect your local Git to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # GitHub will show these commands after repository creation
   
   # Set the main branch name
   git branch -M main
   
   # Link your local repo to GitHub (GitHub will show the exact URL)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
   # Verify the remote connection
   git remote -v
   ```
   ![GitHub Status Now](images/github-4-1-setup.png)
   *You should see something like this after running these commands.*

#### 6. Pushing Changes to GitHub
1. Push your code to GitHub for the first time:
   ```bash
   # The -u flag remembers your preferences for future pushes
   git push -u origin main
   ```
    ![GitHub Push](images/github-6-push.png)
    *You should see something like this after git push.*

2. Verify on `github.com`
  ![GitHub Page](images/github-7-page.png)
  *You should see your github repository having same files you pushed.*

2. Future changes workflow:
   ```bash
   # 1. Check what's changed
   git status
   
   # 2. Stage changes
   git add .
   
   # 3. Save changes locally
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   
   # 4. Upload to GitHub
   git push
   ```

### Common Git Commands Reference
```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# See change history
git log

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name

```

### Tips for Beginners
1. Use `git status` frequently to see what's happening
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Pull changes before starting new work
4. Always check which branch you're on
5. Create a new branch for new features/changes

### Need Help?
- Run `git --help` for command list
- Run `git command --help` for specific command help
- Visit [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com) for tutorials

## Best Practices

1. **Always create a `.devcontainer` folder** in your project root
2. **Document your container setup** in README.md
3. **Use version control** from the start
4. **Keep containers lightweight** - only install what you need
5. **Test container builds regularly** to ensure reproducibility
6. **Share your dev container configuration** with team members

### folder Structure Example:
```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .devcontainer/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ devcontainer.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ your-code-files
```

Remember: Development containers help ensure consistent development environments across team members and reduce the "it works on my machine" problem!

## Terminal Setup and Usage

The terminal is a crucial tool for working with dev containers. Here's how to use it effectively in VS Code:

1. Opening the Integrated Terminal:

![VS Code Terminal Open](images/docker-4-terminal.png)
*Press Ctrl+` or go to View > Terminal to open the integrated terminal*

2. Terminal in Dev Container:
  When inside a dev container, the terminal runs inside the container environment

3. Common Terminal Commands:

![Terminal Commands](images/terminal-4-commands.png)
*Example of running common commands in the terminal: "cd" and "ls"*

### Need Help?
